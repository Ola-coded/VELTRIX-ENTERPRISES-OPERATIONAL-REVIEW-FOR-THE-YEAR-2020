VELTRIX ENTERPRISES OPERATIONAL REVIEW FOR THE YEAR 2020

Introduction

After four intense months of immersing myself in the world of data analytics, this dashboard stands as a reflection of both my learning journey and the power of data-driven storytelling. Through hands-on experience in cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data in Excel, I have translated raw sales figures into actionable business intelligence. This project focuses on Veltrix Enterprises' operational performance in 2020 â€” a year of complexity, but also clarity, thanks to the lens of data.

 Objective

The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate Veltrix Enterprises' performance across key dimensions such as customer value, shipping modes, product categories, and regional revenue trends. The goal was to identify high-performing segments, uncover revenue-driving behaviors, and recommend strategies for business optimization in the coming fiscal year.

Description

This dashboard was built using Microsoft Excel and combines various forms of data visualizations â€” bar charts, pie charts, trend lines, and slicers â€” to create an interactive and insightful review of the companyâ€™s 2020 operations. Key metrics include:
â€¢	Top 5 performing customers
â€¢	Revenue trend over time
â€¢	Shipping mode efficiency
â€¢	Category and regional performance
â€¢	Segment and product-level analysis
With a clean design and intuitive layout, the dashboard empowers decision-makers to gain a holistic view of business health at a glance.

 Insights

ðŸ”¹ Top Customer & Segment
Tamara Chand was recognized as the best customer in terms of total revenue, while the Consumer segment was the highest contributor with 5,101 orders, reflecting the dominance of individual, non-corporate buyers.
ðŸ”¹ Shipping Mode Efficiency
Standard Class accounted for the lionâ€™s share of revenue ($1.34 million), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and popularity. The least-performing was Same Day, possibly due to its higher costs or limited availability.
ðŸ”¹ Category Dominance
Technology emerged as the most lucrative category with $827,455.87 in revenue, followed by Office Supplies and Furniture. This suggests a strong dependence on tech-related products.
ðŸ”¹ Product-Level Revenue
Among individual products, the Staple Envelope led in revenue generation, followed closely by Staples and Easy-Staple Paper â€” all essentials in a remote-working era, showing how consumer needs shifted.
ðŸ”¹ Regional Performance
The Western Region led all others with $710,219.68, aligning with it being the top-performing zone in 2020. The Southern Region contributed the least, revealing potential for strategic development or reassessment.
ðŸ”¹ Revenue Growth Trend
Despite some fluctuations in the earlier years, 2020 closed with a noticeable revenue spike to $28,107, hinting at improved sales strategies or increased demand.

Recommendations

1.	Double Down on Standard Class Shipping
Given its performance, Standard Class should remain the default logistics option. Explore ways to optimize inventory and shipping centers around this mode.
2.	Focus on Technology Expansion
The Technology category is already a strength â€” consider bundling or cross-selling related accessories and software for upselling opportunities.
3.	Nurture Top Customers
Customers like Tamara Chand and Sean Miller have strong purchasing power. Consider loyalty programs, personalized offers, or early-access deals for high-value clients.
4.	Improve Regional Sales in the South
Investigate regional distribution issues or marketing gaps in the South. Could be a matter of pricing, accessibility, or underexposure.
5.	Promote Office Essentials
Given the strong sales in staple products, develop campaigns targeting work-from-home professionals and small businesses â€” possibly with discounted bulk offers.
Conclusion
This dashboard is more than just a project â€” it represents the transformation of data into a story and my evolution as a data analyst. From Excel frustrations to insight eureka moments, this journey has deepened my appreciation for how data can shape strategy and drive success. Veltrix Enterprises now has a clear snapshot of what worked in 2020 and what actions can lead to even stronger results in the future.
